    The "wildcard" identifiers in pulse grammars are now regular OpenQASM 3
    identifiers, without the leading dollar sign (``$``), *e.g.* what was ``$q``
    before is now simply ``q``.  Precise hardware qubits are still referenced
    as ``$0``, for example.  This was made for better consistency in identifiers;
    having the dollar sign in the wildcard carried no information, since it
    applied to any qubit already.
